Handr√© provided an updated nix shell file, so here is a project to test it.

This nix shell file provides pretty much the quivalent of the Haskell platrom.

To run the example, you can run the script like this:

    ./hello_world.hs

Also useful to know:

    You can run a local documentation search engine backed by Hoogle by doing `nix-shell --run "hoogle server --port 8000"`
